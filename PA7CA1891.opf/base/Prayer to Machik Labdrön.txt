Prayer to Machik Labdrön
by Patrul Rinpoche

khyenpa sum gyi neluk ten la beb
Ascertaining the natural state of threefold knowledge,
jorwa shyi yi nyamlen né la juk
And practising the key points of the four applications,
tartuk drebu chökur lek jorwé
One arrives perfectly at the ultimate fruition, dharmakāya—
dü sum gyalwé yum la solwa deb
Mother of the buddhas of the three times, to you I pray!

shyenmé chöku yum dön zabmö ying
Profound basic space, dharmakāya mother beyond attachment,
ngöntok yeshe chakgyar lek jorwé
Manifests perfectly as the wisdom mudrā of clear realization,
namrol duljé nang ngor tröpé tsul
Whose display arises to disciples' perception in wrathful guise—
jetsün tröma nakmö tukjé zik
Exalted Krodhakālī, look upon me with compassion!

drowé dön dzé trulpé namrol gar
Playful dance of emanation bringing benefit to beings,
gyagar yul du penchen mönlam drub
Who fulfilled the aspirations of the great paṇḍitas of India
böyul dro ngor mimö tsul tenpa
And appeared to Tibetans in female human form—
ama lab kyi drönmé jingyi lob
Mother Labkyi Drönma, inspire me with your blessings!

Spoken by the one named Patrul.
