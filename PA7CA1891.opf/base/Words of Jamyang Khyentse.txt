Words of Jamyang Khyentse
as recorded by Jokyab Pema Trinlé Nyingpo

dogyü tenchö mengak zabmo yi
To the root gurus from whom I've received Dharma teachings
chö nam gangné shyüpé tsawa dang
On the sūtras, tantras, treatises and profound pith instructions
gyüpé lama malü tamché la
As well as all the lineage gurus without exception,
taktu güpé yi kyi solwa deb
I pray with a mind of constant devotion.

This was spoken by Jamyang Khyentse.
