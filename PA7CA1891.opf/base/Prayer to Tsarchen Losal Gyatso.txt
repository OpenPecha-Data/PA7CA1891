Prayer to Tsarchen Losal Gyatso
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

lo chok sung gi wangchuk ngurmik gar
Supreme-minded lord of speech in saffron-robed guise,
tayé dro la pendé chok tsol shying
Bestowing supreme benefit and happiness on infinite beings,
tenpa rinchen chok chur salwar dzé
And illuminating the precious teachings in every direction,
nyengyü gyatsö dakpor solwa deb
Mastery of the ocean-like aural transmission, to you I pray.

This came to mind late one evening during the Fire Monkey year.
