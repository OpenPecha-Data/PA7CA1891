Short Prayer to Atiśa
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

sangye nangwa tayé tuk lé trul
Emanated from the heart of the Buddha Amitābha,
pema jungné ngö nang ati sha
Padmasambhava in person, glorious Atiśa,
gangchen bö la kadrin tsungpamé
Unequalled in your kindness to Tibet, the Land of Snows,
dipam karé shyab la solwa deb
Dīpaṃkara, at your feet I pray.

Thus, Chökyi Lodrö offered this prayer on the 18th day of the ninth month of the Fire Monkey
year, during the celebrations to mark the master’s anniversary.
