May the life of the Mañjughoṣa Guru long remain secure,

May the teachings and those who uphold them spread far and wide,

May all the current misery in the land of Tibet be pacified,

Thus, in response to the repeated requests of my own student, the sublime Jamyang Sherab Shenpen
Chökyi Senge, supreme tulku of the Dongna Labrang at Dzongsar Monastery whose noble life
is without blemish and who urged me to expand on the brief version that I had composed
in the past, I, Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, wrote this on the 25th day, the third day of victory
during the waning phase of the third month of the Water Dragon year. May the guru and the
victorious ones and their heirs grant their blessings so that it becomes meaningful.

Although I dare not speak insistently Of my own memories of former lives,I have taken the previous
lives of my noble predecessorAs a basis and written whatever else occurred to me.If
I am at fault let this not become an obscuration,But let the guru and deities grant their
forgiveness.Since all are one within the sphere of natural purity,To that extent, I wonder
if there might be no error.As there is possibly some tiny virtue herein,May I become a suitable
vessel for devotionFor all who rely on me, especially my students,And may we receive
blessings and attainments.
Sarva maṅgalam.
