Prayer to My Root Guru, Jamyang Loter Wangpo
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

khyabdak sangwé dakpo dorjé chang
All-pervasive sovereign, lord of secrets, Vajra Holder,
rabjam gyüdé gyatsö kyilkhor tso
Chief of the maṇḍalas of the infinite, ocean-like tantras,
drenpé sishyi jikpa trok dzepa
To think of you allays the anxieties of existence and quiescence—
jamyang loter wangpor solwa deb
Jamyang Loter Wangpo, to you I pray.

gang ku tongwé dechen yeshe kyé
Seeing your form brings the wisdom of great bliss;
gang sung töpé marik münpa sel
Hearing your voice dispels the darkness of ignorance;
gang tuk drenpé rangrig chökur tön
Recalling your mind reveals the dharmakāya of my own awareness—
palden lamé shyab la solwa deb
Glorious guru, at your feet I pray.

lama heruka pal dorjé chang
Guru heruka, glorious Vajradhara,
khyö kyi tukjé yalwar mi dor shing
Do not neglect me in your compassion,
go sum trulpa tsené chöpa dang
But eradicate the delusion of my three doors
dorjé sum gyi yeshe minpar dzö
And cause the wisdom of the three vajras to mature.

This was written spontaneously while recalling the guru.
