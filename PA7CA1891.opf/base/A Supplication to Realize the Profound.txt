A Supplication to Realize the Profound
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

Namo guru!
chöying kha la tukjé trin trik shing
You cause a pleasant rain of accomplishment and blessings to fall
jinlab ngödrub drang char beb dzepa
From the clouds of compassion gathered in the sky-like dharmadhātu,
tsokyé dorjé khyentsé wangpo la
Lake-born Vajra, Khyentse Wangpo:
miché nying né güpé solwa deb
I supplicate you from the very depths of my heart.

rigdzin drubpa yong kyi dungtsob tu
As the successor of all the vidyādharas and siddhas,
gyalsé sempa kuntuzangpo yi
You are a bodhisattva who has perfected the wisdom
ösal nyingpö gongpé tsaldzokpa
Of the clear light heart-essence of Samantabhadra;
palden lamé dak gyü jingyi lob
Glorious Guru, please bless me to realize this myself!

rangsem döné kyemé rigpé shi
My mind has never been born — this is the nature of awareness.
machö jishyin shyakpé gompa dang
To settle in this experience without the slightest alteration or contrivance is meditation;
panglang dzin tsol dralwé chöpa yi
And conduct is to be without effort or concern for what to do or to avoid —
kadak chöku ngön du gyurwar shok
May I actualize the primordially pure dharmakāya!

Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö wrote this at the request of Thinley Norbu, son of the lord of all the
learned and accomplished ones, Dudjom Choktrul Rinpoche.
