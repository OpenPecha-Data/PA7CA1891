Prayer to Karmapa Khakyab Dorje
by the Fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje

palden tenpé nyima kha tar khyab
Glorious sun of the teachings, all-pervasive like space,
chok gi lodrö ziji rabtu gyé
Your supreme intelligence shines out in brilliant splendour.
dechen yeshe lhenchik kyepé dak
O, sovereign of the primordial, co-emergent wisdom of great bliss,
khakhyab rangjung dorjér solwa deb
Khakhyab Rangjung Dorje, to you I pray!

When authorizing my own students to become masters of ceremonies who grant ripening empowerments
and liberating instructions, in order to fulfil wishes of Thubten Jampal Tsultrim Drakpa
who comes from the East of Serong, Lhatse, the noble vidyādhara Khakyab Dorje wrote this
prayer at the Lhundrub Phodrang of the great retreat centre near Padma Dzong of Tsurphu.
