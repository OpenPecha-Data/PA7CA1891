A Prayer
by the Fifteenth Karmapa, Khakhyab Dorje

kyabné gyatsö dü shyal guru jé
O Lord Guru, embodiment of all the oceanic sources of refuge,
rigdzin khandro damchen tsok ché la
Together with vidyādharas, ḍākinīs, oath-bound dharma protectors and their retinues,
dungshuk drakpö tsechik soldeb na
I fervently and one-pointedly pray to you:
chi nang sangwé barché ying su sol
Please pacify outer, inner and secret obstacles into space,
jikgyé dümin chi dang dra lé gyal
Help me overcome the eight fears, untimely death and enemies,
samdön yishyin drubpar dzé du sol
And cause all my aspirations to be fulfilled just as I wish!
Karmapa Khakyab Dorje wrote this at the request of Rechung Traga. Siddhirastu.
