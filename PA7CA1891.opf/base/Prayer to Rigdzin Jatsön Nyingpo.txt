Prayer to Rigdzin Jatsön Nyingpo
by Jatsön Nyingpo

hrih, machö lhündrub kadak rangjung lé
Hrīḥ! From self-arising primordial purity and unaltered spontaneous presence
chiryang charwé riktsal gyutrul ni
You arose as the magical expression of rigpa appearing in any form—
sang ngak nyingmé tendzin bang riwa
Bangriwa,1 upholder of the Nyingma teachings of secret mantra —
orgyen letro lingpar solwa deb
Orgyen Letro Lingpa, to you I pray!

dangpo dogyü mengak lekpar jang
Initially, you trained thoroughly in sūtras, tantras and pith instructions;
bardu kyedzok yermé drubpa tsuk
Then, you accomplished the inseparability of development and completion;
yangdak dön gyi rabjam bang riwa
Bangriwa, master of the absolute meaning of reality —
rigdzin jatsön nyingpor solwa deb
Rigdzin Jatsön Nyingpo, to you I pray!

gyalwang pemé yangtrul gejong tsul
Emanation of Padmākara, king of victorious ones, in the form of a monk,
kaldü nyikmé drowé pal du shar
You appeared as beings’ splendour in this time of degeneration,
dakdzin rudra jompé bang riwa
Bangriwa, destroyer of the rudra of ego-clinging —
ngakchang hung nak mebar la solwa deb
Ngakchang Hungnak Mebar, to you I pray!

detar solwa tabpé jinlab kyi
Through the blessings of praying in this way,
nekab tartuk ngödrub charbeb shing
May the rain of temporary and ultimate accomplishments shower down,
khyentsé nü den jalü öpung gyur
And may we attain the rainbow body, radiant and endowed with wisdom, compassion and capacity—
dakshyen kyilkhor chik tu drubpar shok
I and others all together in a single maṇḍala.
