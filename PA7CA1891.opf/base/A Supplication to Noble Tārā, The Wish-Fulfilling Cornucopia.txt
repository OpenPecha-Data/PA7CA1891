A Supplication to Noble Tārā, The Wish-Fulfilling Cornucopia1
Taken from the Magical Letters
revealed by Sera Khandro

emaho
Emaho.
kyabné lumé könchok nampa sum
Exalted Tārā, sole embodiment of the blessing and compassion
tukjé jinlab chikdü chomden ma
Of the three rare and sublime ones, the unfailing sources of refuge,
pakma nyerchik shyab la gü chak tsal
I humbly pay homage at your feet
dak sok di né tsé rab tamché du
And those of your twenty-one emanations.

pakma khyé kyi tsewé jezung té
From this very moment and in all lives to come
dak tong tö dang dren rek drowa kün
Pray hold us in your great love.
lab chen changchub sem chok gyü kyé né
May all who see, hear, recall, or come into contact with me in any way, generate magnificent
bodhicitta, most supreme,
nyurdu dzokpé sangye tobpar shok
And swiftly attain complete and perfect awakening.

If you make an effort to recite this supplication continually, there is absolutely no doubt
that Ārya Tārā will care for you.

Thus, in response to the insistent requests of the noble monk-physician Samten, who expressed
a need for something of this kind, the incautious Dewé Dorje wrote this in the isolated
hermitage of Sera Monastery. May virtue abound!
