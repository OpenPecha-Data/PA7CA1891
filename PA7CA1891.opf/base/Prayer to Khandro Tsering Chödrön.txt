In the saṃbhogakāya fields of the five families, you are Vajravārāhī,

Khyentse’s ḍākinī, Tsering Chödrön, Long-life Lamp of Dharma.

And Vajradhara in person, Lord Chökyi Lodrö,

May all your enlightened wishes, without exception, be fulfilled,
dak sok dralwa mepar jingyi lob

With the thought, “May this prayer come true, just as I have wished!” this was offered from
Oḍḍiyāna by the lowest disciple, the one called Yeshe Dorje, better known as the one from
Tarthang, on the twenty-first day of the fourth month.
