Prayer Written for Lama Chödrak
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

jamyang lamé yeshe nampar trul
Manifestation of the Mañjughoṣa Guru’s1 primordial wisdom,
nyikdü ten dro kyobpé pungnyen chok
Sublime friend and protector of the teachings and beings in this degenerate age,
jamyang lodrö gyatsor solwa deb
Jamyang Lodrö Gyatso, to you I pray:
neluk tokpa kyewar jingyi lob
Inspire me to realize the natural state!

kadak rigpa chökü rang shyal tong
May I see my own true face, primordially pure dharmakāya awareness,
lhündrub ösal nangwa tsé la peb
May the spontaneously present visions of clear light reach their full measure,
gangshar chöpa machö rang sar drol
May whatever arises be freed in its own place through uncontrived action,
ku sum shyir né drebu ngöngyur shok
And may I actualize the fruition of the three kāyas present within the ground.

Chökyi Lodrö wrote this at the request of Lama Chödrak, who is eminent on account of his qualities
of learning and realization. May it be virtuous!
