Prayer Composed for Yakzé Tsewang Gyurme
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

namo guru
Namo guru!
sishyi chi pal kunzang dömé gön
Primordial protector Samantabhadra, universal splendour of existence and peace,
nyikdü dak lö münpa selwé nyen
Appearing as a friend to dispel the darkness from my mind in this degenerate age,
jamyang lamé yeshe gyutrul gar
Dance-like emanation of the Mañjughoṣa Guru’s1 pristine wisdom,
lodrö gyatsö shyab la solwa deb
Lodrö Gyatso, at your feet I pray.

changchub bardu dralmé jesu zung
Until I awaken, hold me in your care without ever parting.
mögü dungshuk drakpö soldeb na
As I call out to you with intense and ardent devotion,
riktong ösal chöku tokpa dang
May I realize the dharmakāya luminosity of awareness and emptiness,
pochen jalü dorjé ku tob shok
And may I attain the vajrakāya, the rainbow body of great transference.

Thus, this was composed by Chökyi Lodrö, who holds the name of a tulku of Jamyang Khyentse,
in response to the repeated requests of Yakzé Tsewang Gyurme. May virtue abound.
