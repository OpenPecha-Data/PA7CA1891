Prayer to Ārya Tārā
by Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpai Nyima

gyalwa kün gyi tukjé trinlé nam
Embodiment of the compassion and activity of all Victorious Ones,
chikdü jetsün nyurma pamö shyab
Noble Lady, swift and heroic,
solwa deb so di chi bardo kün
To you I pray: in this life, the next and the intermediate state,
jik dang dukngal tsok lé kyab tu sol
May you protect us from the hosts of fears and sufferings!

May there be virtue and auspiciousness.
