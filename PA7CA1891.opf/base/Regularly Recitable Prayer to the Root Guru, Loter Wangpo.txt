Regularly Recitable Prayer to the Root Guru
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

kyabné kündü den sum tsangwé ku
You embody all sources of refuge, the three seats complete within your form,
nyönmong dung sel chö dra drokpé sung
Your speech proclaims the Dharma that dispels the torment of the afflictions,
yeshe ngaden dé sal mitok tuk
And your mind possesses the five wisdoms and bliss, clarity and non-thought—
sangwa dzinpé dakpo dorjé chang
Sovereign preserver of secrets, Vajra Holder,
loter wangpö shyab la solwa deb
Loter Wangpo, at your feet I pray:
go sum ngöpo kün gyi chöpar gyi
With body, speech and mind, I offer everything to you.
chi nang sangwé barché kün sel shying
Dispel all outer, inner and secret obstacles.
damtsik nyamchak nyetung drima shak
I confess all faults and impairments and breakages of samaya.
sampa tamché lhün gyi drubpa dang
Cause all my wishes to be spontaneously fulfilled.
chok dang tünmong ngödrub tsal du sol
Grant the supreme and common attainments, I pray.
rangshyen dön nyi drubpar jingyi lob
Inspire me to fulfil my own and others’ purpose.
changchub bardu dralmé tukjé zung
Hold me in your compassion, never parting, until awakening.

Chökyi Lodrö composed this readily recitable prayer as a means to reinvigorate devotion. May
it become a cause for the swift infusion of blessings. Maṅgalam.
