The actual embodiment of all the victorious buddhas of the three times

And sole refuge for the teachings and beings of this degenerate age was Khyentse Wangpo.

Manifestation of his supreme blessings and compassion,

Jamyang Chökyi Lodrö, to you I pray!

dak sok drowé lona chö la gyur
Cause my own and other beings’ minds to turn towards the Dharma,
neluk rang shyal jalwar jingyi lob
And inspire me to encounter my own true face, the natural state!

chirol zungwé yul gyi ma gö shing
Unstained by any objects perceived as external,
nang du dzinpé tokpé malepar
And unspoilt by any inner perceiving thoughts—
machö rangbab gompé ngang kyangwé
Sustaining an uncontrived experience of settled meditation,
rangsem chönyi jenpar charwar shok
May the dharmatā condition of my own mind nakedly arise!

This is the wisdom intent of all the buddhas.
tak ché lo dé nyamlen zabmo yi
Through the profound practice of decisive contentment,
rangrig ku sum gongpa ngöngyur té
Inspire me to realize the three kāyas of my own awareness
khorwa dong né trukpar jingyi lob
And to empty saṃsāra from its very depths!

Khangsar.
