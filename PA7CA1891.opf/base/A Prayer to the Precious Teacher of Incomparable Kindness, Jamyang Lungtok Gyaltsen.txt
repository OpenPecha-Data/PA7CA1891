A Prayer to the Precious Teacher of Incomparable Kindness, Jamyang Lungtok Gyaltsen
by Akhyuk Rinpoche Lungtok Gyaltsen

om svasti
Oṃ svasti
pak yul drubpé wangchuk shantipa
In the noble land of India, you were Śāntipa, lord of siddhas,
bö yül pemé jé zung drok mi dang
In Tibet, you were Drokmi Palgyi Yeshe, Langdro Lotsāwa,
langdro lotsa gyalwa chok yang sok
Gyalwa Chokyang and others, guided and cared for by Padmasambhava,
drubpé rigdzin nam kyi nam trülpa
Emanation of accomplished vidyādharas,
nyik dü gyalwé wangpo longchen dang
In this degenerate age, you appear as the emanation of Longchenpa, lord of the victorious ones,
long sal palgyi trulpa shenyen tsül
And the glorious Longsal Nyingpo, in the form of a spiritual friend.
rigdzin gongma nam kyi yong ngakpa
Praised and prophesied by vidyādharas of the past,
dzokchen tenpé nyingpo dro la pel
You transmit the teachings to beings the essence of the Dzogchen teachings—
lungtok tsawé lamar solwa dep
Jamyang Lungtok Gyaltsen, root teacher, to you I pray!
kyé dang trengwa tsé rab tamché du
Throughout the succession of all my lives to come,
gönpo khyé dang nam yang mi dralwar
May I never be separate from you, my sole protector.
dzok min jangwa gyatso tar chin né
Through vast, ocean-like activity of perfecting, maturing and purifying,
kyé chi bardö trül nang ying su dak
May the deluded perceptions of life, death and the bardo be purified into all-pervading space,
dro nam dechen shying la longchö shok
And may all beings come to experience the blissful land of Sukhāvatī!

The brazen old fibber (Jamyang Lungtok Gyaltsen) wrote this in order to increase the pure perception
of his disciples. May virtue abound. Sarva maṅgalam.
