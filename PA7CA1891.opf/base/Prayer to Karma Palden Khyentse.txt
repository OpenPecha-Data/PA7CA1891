Prayer to Karma Palden Khyentse
by Jamyang Khyentse Chökyi Lodrö

om swasti
Oṃ svasti!
dü sum gyalwa malü düpé ngö
Actual embodiment of all the victorious ones of the three times,
rik kün khyabdak jamgön trulpé ku
Omnipresent lord of all buddha families, nirmāṇakāya Mañjunātha,
karma palden khyentsé özer la
Karma Palden Khyentse Özer,
nying né soldeb dak gyü jingyi lob
I pray to you from the depth of my heart: inspire me with your blessings!

ngejung changsem gyü la kyewa dang
Cause renunciation and bodhicitta to arise in my stream of being,
tukgyü gongpé jin chen powa lé
And through transmitting the great blessing of your wisdom intent,
rangrig nyukma chakgya chenpo yi
Cause the realization of Mahāmudrā, my own genuine awareness,
tokpa yangdak jishyin trungpar shok
To arise authentically, just as it is, within my mind!

di chi bardö nekab tamché du
In this life, the next, and all the phases of the intermediate state,
jamgön yishyin norbü jezung né
May I be guided and cared for by you, Gentle Lord and Wish-Fulfilling Gem,
sangwa sum dang yermé gyur né kyang
And having become inseparable from your secret body, speech and mind,
rangshyen dön nyi lhün gyi drubpar shok
May the twofold benefit of myself and others be spontaneously accomplished!

Chökyi Lodrö wrote this in response to a request from Jñāna Choktrul of Lhateng.
