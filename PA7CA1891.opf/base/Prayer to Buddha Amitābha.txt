Prayer to Buddha Amitābha
by Dodrupchen Jigme Tenpai Nyima

gyalwa öpakmé gön la
O Victorious One and Protector Amitābha,
solwa deb so jingyi lob
To you I pray: inspire me with your blessing.
tsé di pö matak pa ru
As soon as it is time to leave this life behind,
dewachen du drang du sol
Guide me, I pray, to the realm of Sukhāvatī!

For Lobzang.
