Prayer to Shechen Kongtrul as Vajrasattva
by Khenpo Tsöndrü

tsen tsam dzinpé ngensong jik kyobpa
You are Vajrasattva, lord of a hundred buddha families, in person,
rik gyé khyabdak dorjé sempa ngö
Whose name alone guards against the terrors of the lower realms.
pema drimé lekpé lodrö la
Pema Drimé Lekpé Lodrö, from the depth of my heart, I pray to you:
nying né solwa deb so wang jin tsol
Grant me empowerments and blessings!

om maha guru pema bimala mati shri bendzra sata kaya waka tsitta abhi kintsi sarwa siddhi pala
ah hum
oṃ mahāguru padma vimala mati śrī vajrasatva kāya vāk citta abhiṣiñca sarva siddhi phala āḥ
hūṃ

mong dang marik trulpé shyenwang gi
May all impairments of samayas of body, speech and mind,
ku sung tuk kyi damtsik nyampa kün
Brought about through bewilderment, ignorance and delusion,
kyé gak nyimé tongpanyi du dak
Be purified in emptiness that is beyond the duality of arising and ceasing
riktong dorjé sempé shyal tong shok
And may I see awareness and emptiness, the true face of Vajrasattva!

Vīrya, who who has the appearance of a virtuous monk, offered this prayer on the 11th day of
the seventh month of the Earth Pig year (1959) from the snowy regions of Yolmo in Nepal.
